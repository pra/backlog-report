Backlog Report

This a Jira report plugin which gives a "backlog" report, both in html and excel.

It is very specific for our setup where we:
* Uses one project for several products
* Products are components name spaced with "p:" (the product selector select components prefixed with p:)
* Have themes expressed as component name spaced with "t:"
* Have Super Stories (the currently have to be named Super Story" as type
* Have stories that are either sub-tasks to a super story or is a stand alone issue of any type
* Have versions that are time boxed releases

If that feels OK. Build and install.

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into JIRA and starts it on http://localhost:2990/jira
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running JIRA instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK

Full documentation is always available at:

  http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DEVNET/Developing+your+Plugin+using+the+Atlassian+Plugin+SDK

To test the plugin, a test installation can be done from command line. JRebel is supported out of the box.

Run:

  atlas-run --jvmargs "-javaagent:$JREBEL_HOME/jrebel.jar -XX:MaxPermSize=256M -Dmyproject.root=$PWD" 

Test data is available in src/test/resources/test-setup.zip. 
Copy it to target/jira/home/import/ and import it into the running Jira.
